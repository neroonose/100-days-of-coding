# 100-days-of-coding

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code repository! This is where I will document my journey of coding for 100 days straight. I will be sharing my progress throughout this journey.

I'm excited to take on this challenge and see where this journey takes me. I hope you will join me on this journey and follow my progress. If you're also taking on the 100 Days of Code challenge, feel free to reach out and share your progress. Let's support each other and become better coders together!
